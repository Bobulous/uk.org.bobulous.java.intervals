		<p>A library of Java classes which support the concept of mathematical
			intervals.</p>
		<p>In mathematics an interval is a contiguous section through a set
			which has a natural ordering. The interval defines the least and
			greatest values from that set which are included in the interval, and
			these limits are known as endpoints. An interval also defines whether
			each endpoint is closed or open. A closed endpoint includes its own
			value as being within the interval. An open endpoint does not include
			its own value within the interval.</p>
		<p>For example, using integers as the naturally ordered set, you could
			define a closed interval [0, 9] which includes zero, nine, and every
			integer between the two. Or, switching to the set of real numbers, you
			could define an open interval (-10.0, 10.0) which includes every real number
			between negative ten and ten, but <strong>does not</strong> include the
			values negative ten or ten.</p>
		<p>Note that in mathematics a closed endpoint is denoted with a square
			bracket, and an open endpoint is denoted with a parenthesis. It is also
			possible to define an interval where one endpoint is open and the other
			is closed. For example, on the set of integers, the interval (0, 5]
			includes every integer between zero and five, and also includes five,
			but does not include zero.</p>
		<p>An interval can also be unbounded, which is represented in
			mathematics by specifying negative/positive infinity. For example, the
			unbounded integer interval (0, ∞) includes all integers greater than
			zero, whereas the real number interval (-∞, 0.0) includes all real
			numbers less than zero. In this library, infinity is represented in
			an endpoint value by the <code>null</code> object, allowing
			unbounded endpoints to be defined.</p>
		<p>This library allows an interval to be defined within any basis type
			<code>T</code> which implements <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>.
			The type must be comparable with itself because this comparison
			determines the natural ordering of the type. Types which meet this
			requirement include <code>Integer</code>, <code>Double</code>,
			<code>Character</code>, <code>String</code>, and
			<code>BigDecimal</code>. Other examples of naturally ordered types
			include <code>Date</code> and <code>Calendar</code>, but be careful
			with these types because they produce mutable objects, and an
			<code>Interval</code> cannot stop its endpoint values being altered
			if mutable types are used. If mutable types are used for an
			<code>Interval</code>, then it is recommended that great care be
			taken, and that neither the resulting <code>Interval</code> objects
			nor the objects which form their endpoints ever be shared.</p>
