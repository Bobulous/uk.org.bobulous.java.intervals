/**
 * A concrete implementation of an <code>Interval</code> over any naturally
 * ordered type.
 * <p>
 * Each <code>GenericInterval</code> contains a lower endpoint value and an
 * upper endpoint value such that the result of
 * <code>lower.compareTo(upper)</code> must be zero or greater. In other words,
 * the upper endpoint must be equal to or greater than the lower endpoint
 * according to the natural ordering of the interval basis type.</p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if an <code>GenericInterval&lt;Integer&gt;</code> object (an
 * interval of integers) has a lower endpoint value of zero then its upper
 * endpoint value must be zero or greater. If an
 * <code>GenericInterval&lt;Character&gt;</code> (an interval of character
 * values) had a lower endpoint value of <code>'a'</code> then its upper
 * endpoint value would have to be <code>'a'</code> or <code>'b'</code> or any
 * other character which causes <code>lower.compareTo(upper)</code> to return
 * zero or greater.</p>
 * <p>
 * If an endpoint is <code>null</code> then it means that the endpoint is
 * unbounded and there is no limit to what is included in that direction. So a
 * <code>null</code> lower endpoint means that the lower endpoint is unbounded
 * and the interval includes every value which is less than the upper endpoint
 * value; a <code>null</code> upper endpoint means that the upper endpoint is
 * unbounded and the interval includes every value greater than the lower
 * endpoint value; and if both endpoints are <code>null</code> then all values
 * are included in this interval. In effect, a lower endpoint of
 * <code>null</code> equates to a lower endpoint having the value negative
 * infinity, and an upper endpoint of <code>null</code> equates to an upper
 * endpoint having the value positive infinity. Note that <code>null</code>
 * itself is <strong>never</strong> included in an interval, as
 * <code>null</code> represents the lack of a value. Be aware that
 * <code>null</code> endpoints will allow any value of the permitted type,
 * including values such as <code>Double.NaN</code> (which is supposed to
 * represent a non-value value).</p>
 * <p>
 * Also note that a type constant which is intended to represent infinity, such
 * as <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code>, is just another numeric value so
 * far as the <code>Comparable</code> interface is concerned, and is therefore
 * just another member of the naturally ordered set Double so far as
 * <code>Interval&lt;Double&gt;</code> is concerned. Specifying such a value for
 * an endpoint is not the same as specifying <code>null</code> because
 * <code>null</code> will admit any value belonging to the interval basis type,
 * whereas a pseudo-infinite value such as <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code>
 * will exclude any values which are beyond it in the natural order of the basis
 * type. For example, <code>Double.NaN</code> is considered greater than
 * <code>Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</code> and also greater than
 * <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code> according to the <code>compareTo</code>
 * method of <code>Double</code>.</p>
 * <p>
 * An interval can include zero, one or both of its endpoint values. This is
 * specified by the mode of each endpoint.
 * {@link Interval.EndpointMode#CLOSED EndpointMode.CLOSED} means that the
 * endpoint value itself is included in the interval, while
 * {@link Interval.EndpointMode#OPEN EndpointMode.OPEN} means that the endpoint
 * value itself is not included in the interval. For instance, an
 * <code>Interval&lt;Double&gt;</code> might have a lower endpoint value of zero
 * and a lower endpoint mode of <code>EndpointMode.OPEN</code> which means that
 * zero is the lower limit of the interval but is not included in the interval.
 * The endpoint mode is irrelevant for a null endpoint.</p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> Because an <code>Interval</code> relies on the
 * <code>Comparable</code> interface, everything depends on the result returned
 * by the <code>compareTo</code> method. So be aware that a <code>Double</code>
 * object with value <code>-0.0</code> (negative zero) is considered by
 * compareTo to be less in value than a <code>Double</code> object with value
 * <code>0.0</code> (positive zero) even though almost all applications would
 * consider these two values to be identical. Be careful not to allow a negative
 * zero to be used as an endpoint value without understanding that it will be
 * treated differently.</p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> Because the <code>Comparable</code> interface
 * offers no way to measure distance between two comparable objects, it is not
 * always possible to check an whether an open, integer-based interval is empty.
 * For instance, the open integer interval (1, 2) is empty, because there is no
 * integer value in-between one and two. But because two is greater than one and
 * because the <code>Comparable</code> interface offers no way to measure the
 * distance between two <code>Integer</code> objects, it is not possible for
 * this class to detect that this interval is in fact empty. This will result in
 * incorrect values being returned by the methods of this class under such
 * circumstances. For this reason, think carefully before creating an open
 * interval of integer-based objects such as <code>Integer</code>,
 * <code>Date</code>, <code>Character</code>, <code>String</code>, etc. Use
 * closed intervals for these types wherever possible.</p>
 * <p>
 * Objects of type <code>GenericInterval</code> cannot be mutated, but it is
 * only safe to consider them truly immutable if they are based on an immutable
 * type. So a <code>GenericInterval&lt;String&gt;</code> is truly immutable
 * because neither the <code>GenericInterval</code> nor the <code>String</code>
 * objects acting as endpoints can be mutated. But a
 * <code>GenericInterval&lt;Date&gt;</code> cannot be considered immutable
 * because even though the <code>GenericInterval</code> cannot be mutated, the
 * <code>Date</code> objects acting as endpoints can be mutated. This also means
 * that a <code>GenericInterval</code> of a mutable type cannot be guaranteed to
 * maintain the order of its endpoints, so the lower endpoint may suddenly be
 * mutated to have a greater value than the upper endpoint. For this reason it
 * is strongly recommended that <code>GenericInterval</code> is only used with
 * immutable types. If a <code>GenericInterval</code> is created over a mutable
 * type, then both the <code>GenericInterval</code> and its endpoint objects
 * must be kept safe, and must not be shared.</p>
